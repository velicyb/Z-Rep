# Z-Rep
Experimental research into cryptoeconomic reputation systems and performance art inspired by Psycholonials.

## Current Status
Contemplating Philosophy of Finance, velocity vs. accumulation, and increasingly esoteric units of measurement, while revisiting Psycholonials via listening to Let's Plays.

## A Basic Introduction
Z-Rep seeks to test a loosely held and variably silly and/or serious investment thesis: "Economics is Art."  
It is also, admittedly, a form of protest art, in support of honest communication of preferences being protected speech under The First Amendment of The United States of America.  
It is also designed to be an elaborate Rube Goldberg device that still rather succinctly demonstrates established practices of market regulation are increasingly literally laughably obsolete.  
If that's something that professionally concerns you, please know I'm not trying to cause trouble, I'm just trying to provide some entertainment, and hopefully make you smile.

## The Essential Design
What if you had total control over the money printers and could give any amount to anyone for any reason at any time?  
And what if, thanks to the complexities of Artificial Intelligence and Cryptoeconomics, it somehow actually worked just fine?  
I don't want to pretend anyone is about to be able to summon infinite resources out of thin air, but I do believe in radical and rapid democratization of financial technology for the masses.  
And I am myself pleasingly entertained by making a project of reimagining economics in character as a savant clown who half-seriously answers the question: "What if The Joker was an Economist?"
